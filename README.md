# 🛒 Walmart Sales Predictor

A full-stack data science and web application that predicts sales for Walmart based on historical patterns, holidays, weather, and economic signals. Built with machine learning, Flask, and a user-friendly interface — this project reduces excess stock and promotes eco-smart retail planning.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Walmart stores often struggle with demand volatility due to seasonal shifts, holidays, and unpredictable trends. Our system analyzes key features like holiday indicators, pricing, and weather to forecast product-level sales, helping:
- Prevent **understocking** and lost revenue
- Avoid **overstocking** and waste (eco-smart inventory!)
- Visualize trends for smart decisions
